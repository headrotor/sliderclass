#sliderclass

Sliderclass is a [processing](http://processing.org) and [processing.js](http://processingjs.org) class for use in interactive simulations or wherever you have multiple variables you want the user to control. 

Based on [vertical-scrollbar](http://forum.processing.org/topic/vertical-scrollbar#25080000001583409) by "raron"

Made JS-safe by renaming "over()" function, which can't be the same as boolean
variable "over"

Built on Topics/GUI/Scrollbar example in processing 1.2.1 (and 1.5.1).

Share & enjoy!
